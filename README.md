# Iridium
A register-based VM in Rust. Our goals are:

1. Erlang VM-level resiliency
2. Tight integration with a language (see the Palladium project)
3. Horizontal scalability

## Important
Iridium is not yet 0.1. Anything can change at any time. *Do not use it for anything in production.* You can follow development here https://gitlab.com/subnetzero/iridium. GitLab is the authoritative home; the project is mirrored to GitHub.

## Manual
You can find the details of how the VM works here: https://gitlab.com/subnetzero/iridium/blob/master/docs/manual.adoc
